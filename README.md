🎵 Spotify Clone – My First Web Development Project  

📌 About the Project  
This project is my first web development endeavor, built entirely using **HTML and CSS**.  
It replicates the core layout and styling of Spotify, focusing on **UI design, responsiveness,  
and structured styling** without any backend functionality.  

Through this project, I have gained hands-on experience in creating visually appealing  
web interfaces using only front-end technologies.  

🎨 Technologies Used  
- HTML5  
- CSS3  

📂 Project Structure 

📄 index.html → Main structure of the webpage  
🎨 style.css → Styling and layout  

🚀 How to Run  
Simply open `index.html` in a web browser to view the project.
