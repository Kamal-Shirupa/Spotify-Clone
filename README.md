🎵 Spotify Clone – My First Web Development Project

This project is my first web development endeavor, built entirely using HTML and CSS. It replicates the core layout and styling of Spotify, focusing on UI design, responsiveness, and structured styling without any backend functionality. Through this project, I have gained hands-on experience in creating visually appealing web interfaces using only front-end technologies.
